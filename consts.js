Don't just give up. Life is about getting knocked down over and over, but still getting up each time. If you keep getting up, you win. 
Don't be discouraged. It's often the last key in the bunch that opens the lock.

In a world of worriers, be the warrior.
Unless you are willing to experience new things, you'll never realize your full potential.`;
